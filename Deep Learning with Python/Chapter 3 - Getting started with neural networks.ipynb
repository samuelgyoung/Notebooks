    "<h2>Layers: the building blocks of deep learning</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "A layer is a data-processing module that takes as input one or more tensors and that outputs one or more tensors. Some layers are stateless, but more frequently layers have a state: the layer’s weights, one or several tensors learned with stochastic gradient descent, which together contain the network’s knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different layers are appropriate for different tensor formats. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simple vector data, stored in 2D tensors of shape (samples, features), is often processed by densely connected layers, also called fully connected or dense layers (the Dense class in Keras)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sequence data, stored in 3D tensors of shape (samples, timesteps, features), is typically processed by recurrent layers such as an LSTM layer\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Image data, stored in 4D tensors, is usually processed by 2D convolution layers (Conv2D).\n",
    "\n",
    "Layer compatibility here refers specifically to the fact that every layer will only accept input tensors of a certain shape and will return output tensors of a cer- tain shape. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "#A dense layer with 32 output units\n",
    "\n",
    "from keras import layers\n",
    "\n",
    "layer = layers.Dense(32, input_shape=(784,))\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re creating a layer that will only accept as input 2D tensors where the first dimen- sion is 784 (axis 0, the batch dimension, is unspecified, and thus any value would be accepted). This layer will return a tensor where the first dimension has been trans- formed to be 32.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus this layer can only be connected to a downstream layer that expects 32- dimensional vectors as its input. When using Keras, you don’t have to worry about compatibility, because the layers you add to your models are dynamically built to match the shape of the incoming layer. For instance, suppose you write the following:\n",

    "from keras import models\n",

    "model.add(layers.Dense(32, input_shape=(784,))) \n",
    "\n",
    "model.add(layers.Dense(32))\n",
    "\n",
    "The second layer didn’t receive an input shape argument—instead, it automatically inferred its input shape as being the output shape of the layer that came before.\n"
