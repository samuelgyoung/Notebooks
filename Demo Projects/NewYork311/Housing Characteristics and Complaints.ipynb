Use the PLUTO dataset for the borough that you already identified to focus on the last exercise.Ensure that you use only a limited number of fields from the dataset so that you are not consuming too much memory during your analysis.\n",

Upload the notebook in the subsection called \"Question 3 - Does the Complaint Type, that you identified in response to Question 1, have an obvious relationship with any particular characteristic(s) of the Houses?\" in the section \"Submit your work and Review your Peer's work\" in the module \"Submit Your Work and Grade Your Peers\".\n"
